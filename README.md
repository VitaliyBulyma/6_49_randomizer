# 6_49_randomizer (JavaScript)
 An app that returns top six random numbers in a range from 1 to 49 from a pool of random numbers set out by user input.
 Not recommended to run more than 60 million random numbers at this moment, since it might crash the browser




# To do:
[] Add "Top Six" random numbers output
[] Re-arrange "all random numbers" output
[] Add User Input box
[] Add "Submit" button which will send user input number to a function that will return random numbers
[] Add user input interface/work on page styling
