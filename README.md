 An app that returns top six random numbers in a range from 1 to 49 from a pool of random numbers set by user input.
 In the example below, app created 60000 random numbers in the range, and counted how many times each number occured.

## To do:
 [x] Create a function to make single random number in the range from 1 to 49 
 
 [x] Create a function to return random numbers with some text to html page for better visualization, and add those numbers to an array of random numbers
 
 [x] Function to count how many times each number occured in the array by looping each number(1-49) as a parameter
 
 [x] Create key:value pairs
 
 [ ] Come up with the way to sort by :value 

 [ ] Select top six from sorted array
 
 ## The problem
 
    Need to find a way to sort by :value but maintain key: association 
 
 [ ] Add User Input box 
 
 [ ] Add "Submit" button which will send user input number to a function that will return random numbers
 
 [ ] Output "Top Six" random numbers
 
 [ ] Add styling to the page
 
 [ ] Add input validation
